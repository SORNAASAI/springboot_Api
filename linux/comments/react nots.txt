location.state is often used to pass state when navigating between pages or components.
const { product } = location.state || {}; is a destructuring assignment used in JavaScript to extract the product property from an object.
location.state || {}: This part is a fallback mechanism. If location.state is undefined or null, it falls back to an empty object ({}). This ensures that the destructuring does not throw an error if location.state is not defined.
