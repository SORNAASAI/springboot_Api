Traps: A trap is an interrupt generated by the CPU when a user-level program attempts to execute a privileged instruction or encounters an error. When a trap occurs, the CPU transfers control to the kernel and executes a trap handler. The trap handler checks the type of trap and takes appropriate action, such as terminating the program or performing a privileged operation on behalf of the program.
System calls: A system call is a request made by a user-level program to the OS to perform a privileged operation, such as reading from or writing to a file or allocating memory. To make a system call, the program executes a special instruction that triggers a software interrupt. The OS then transfers control to the kernel and executes a system call handler. The system call handler checks the type of system call and takes appropriate action, such as reading from a file or allocating memory.
Traps and system calls are similar in that they both involve transferring control to the kernel to perform privileged operations. However, traps are usually generated automatically by the CPU when a program encounters an error or attempts to execute a privileged instruction, while system calls are initiated by the program itself to request privileged operations.

Advantages of Simple/Monolithic Structure
It delivers better application performance because of the few interfaces between the application program and the hardware.
It is easy for kernel developers to develop such an operating system.
Disadvantages of Simple/Monolithic Structure
The structure is very complicated, as no clear boundaries exist between modules.
It does not enforce data hiding in the operating system.

notes
the entire operating system runs as a single program in kernel mode.
The operating system is
written as a collection of procedures, linked together into a single large executable
binary program.
a crash in any of these
procedures will take down the entire operating system.
